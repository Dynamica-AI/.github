# Privacy Policy for Dynamica

_Last updated: 24 June 2025_

## Introduction

Dynamica ("we," "us," or "our") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you use our browser extension, Dynamica ("Product"). By installing and using Dynamica, you agree to the collection and use of your data as described below.

## Information We Collect

### 1. User Questions and Input

- When you type a question or input into Dynamica, this text is saved locally in your browser storage to prevent data loss in case of page reloads or crashes (it eases user interaction).
- Upon submission, your question is sent to our server to allow the generation of a helpful response.

### 2. User Identifier (User ID)

- To help us improve the product and analyze usage patterns, Dynamica generates a **random, anonymous user identifier (User ID)** when you first use the extension.
- This User ID is a large random number stored locally in your browser's storage and sent with your questions and feedback to our servers.
- The User ID does **not** contain any personally identifiable information and cannot be traced back to you individually.

### 3. Feedback Data

- You can provide feedback on our responses using the "like" or "dislike" buttons.
- Feedback data, including your User ID and whether you liked or disliked a response, is sent to our server and stored there.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Questions and User ID**: To correlate questions with feedback and usage patterns, enabling us to identify popular questions and improve the product.
- **Feedback**: To assess the quality of our responses and guide product enhancements.
- **Local Storage**: To save your input temporarily to prevent loss in case of page reloads or crashes.

## Data Storage and Security

- All user questions, User IDs, and feedback are stored securely in our backend database hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.

## Data Sharing

- We do **not** share your data with any third parties except as necessary to provide and improve our service.
- Data may be accessed by authorized personnel involved in product development and support.

## User Responsibilities

- Dynamica provides guidance and advice based on your questions but does not make decisions for you.
- You are responsible for understanding the implications of your actions on any platform that Dynamica assists with.
- We disclaim any liability for mistakes or unintended consequences resulting from your use of the service.

## Your Consent

- By using Dynamica, you consent to the collection, use, and storage of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.
- If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the Dynamica extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. At this stage (during the Minimum Viable Product phase), we are unable to notify users directly of changes. However, we plan to implement user authentication in a future update, which will enable us to provide direct notifications about policy changes.

Until then, we recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically. While we do not anticipate frequent updates before authentication is available, changes may still occur. Your continued use of Dynamica constitutes acceptance of the current version of this policy.
